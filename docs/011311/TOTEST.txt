Dear Helber,
We will download it. Thank you!


When you get the 9 STBs, there are something you should know first.

- They are assembled by our RD hands, so the power switch may not work well and the
case may kind of loose.

- This version provide you to change OSD resolution. Here is how you control it.

        1. to set resolution
        caResChanger.toSetResolution(  "800x600" );

        PS.
        A. the resolution value is not restricted and free to set to any value at
this moment.

        2. to restart arora

        caResChanger.toSetParameter( "xxx.html" );
        caResChanger.toQuit();

        PS.
        A.The "toSetParameter()" function must be set before calling "toQuit",
otherwise you will get a blank screen.
        B. xxx.html is the page you want to show on next start. Ex. It can be
index.html or a settings html.

   Please note that in our start up script, we launch a task manager first, and then
task manager launch the arora. Please don't kill task manager. Otherwise, the
whole system can't work.

- This version may not have a good testing, we may need your help to upgrade our
firmware later.

- This version should have a better performance on multicast. However, we are still
trying to make it better, and need your help to check if there is side-effect.


According to your requirement in 2010/12/31 mail, below is our estimation of schedule:

1. Buffer control:
   Before getting your protocol and server program, we will develop our code with
RTP header. This may take 2-3 weeks. I suppose we could finish the programming in
2-3 weeks when getting your protocol and server program. (may not include
debugging.)
2. Subtitles:
   Our engineer is focus on this item now. How to provide a way for you to show the
sub-title. Or we do this inside our player? We will update to you in one week.
3. Volume control:
   The volume control is almost done in our html object. Could you please tell us
how you will use it in use case? (During playback, and then control the volume
with OSD display? Or something else?) You could try them by below description.

        1. to change volume,
                caMediaPlayer.toSetVolume( value );

                PS. The default value is 29 , and the max value is 33

                2. to set volume to mute directly
                caMediaPlayer.toSetVolumeMute();

4. Stand by and wake up:
   For a fake power down, we will just turn all video and audio output down. We will
provide this feature in our object. And it could be done in one week. (Or you
want to let the CPU is in sleeping?)
5. Start up screen:
   Please provide your bmp file. We could make it work at next release.

- Multi-cast issue:
  Continue tracking this issue and make it better.


Let's talk tomorrow. Have a nice night.

Cheers,
Frank
