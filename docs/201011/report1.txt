About igmp, whe solved issue. The query isn't pass on vlan on cianet environment (we don't know why, but we solve with a bridge). Thank for reply and sory by mistake.

Please send 10 more STB to cianet (with remote control and if exists a case).

When we play video for long time happens:
<shell>
(*) --------------------  STARTING MEMORY DEFRAGMENTATION !!!  -------------------
(!) SMP8634: *** Out of video memory ! ***
</shell>

Killing arora and try run happens:
<shell>
(!) Driver getting globals=0x543750
(!) DirectFB/Core: Could not initialize 'gfxcard' core!
    --> Out of video memory!
(!) System is going down !!
(!) System is down!!
(#) DirectFBError [QDirectFBScreen: error creating DirectFB interface]: Out of video memory!
directfb: driver cannot connect
Aborted
</shell>


There are some instability on STB yet:
	Some times, the stb stop to respond.

	The system go slow, we try to reset and stb back still slow. We cut energy (full shutdown ;) ) stb back good. Looks hardware issue.



Some big changes (jumping to next level):

Buffer control (Priority):
	We are developing a multicast cache server with a protocol to recover lost udp packets.
	Then we need a way to control stb buffer, to re-inject lost packets inside the buffer.
	In addiction we need a way to control buffer size, cache sbt control, cache reset, ...

Subtitles:
	We need a way to attach subtitle on media (download srt or sub file from server) and control system time (sync, ntpdate) on stb.
	hwclock on stb returns (maybe kernel module rtc):
		hwclock: can't open '/dev/misc/rtc': No such file or directory

Volume control:
	We need a way to control volume level on stb using arora.

Stand by and wake up:
	We need a way to fake power down (sleep), using remote and wake up.

Start up screen:
	Who to enable a startup screen, like fedora plymouth, ubuntu upstart or something like?




Our next steps are:
	1 - Test 10 more stb on laboratory and try to solve problems, and put all systems on stability (network, encoders, stb,...).
	2 - When this is done, we are start a out of laboratory tests (covering some end user home). Then we planning 100 to 200 stb.
	3 - Near July or August we preview a request of 100.000 to 150.000 stb from cameo.
