1. The player will try to load a subtitle file in the same directory where media file
locates first, and then go to find in download directory ( default is "/tmp" )and load it automatically.

(The subtitle file must have the same name as media file for auto loading. e.g. xxx.mp4 -> xxx.srt. )

Besides, subtitle files can be also fetched form the Internet by calling
"toFetchSubtitleFile( char *fullName )". Once the file is downloaded, users can set the fetched subtitle name to the player by using "toSetSubtitleFileName( char *fileName ) ". The player will reload the downloaded file and display lines on screen.

(The downloaded file can be different name but mus be in SRT format. )


2. In this version, font color and size can be changed during playing. more detail please have a look "new functions in Media Player Ver 0.1.0"

new functions in Media Player Ver 0.1.0
// for information
bool toSetInfoFontfile( char *fontName );    // to set font file for infomation , fontName = /xxx/xxx/aaa.ttf
bool toSetInfoFontColor( int r, int g, int b, int a );  // to set font color, each value should be between 0 -255.  r =red, g=green, b=blue, a = alpha
bool toSetInfoFontUp( void );  // to increase font size ( ie. to reduce font ratio by font gap each time )
bool toSetInfoFontDown( void ); // to decrease font size ( ie. to add font ratio by font gap each time )
int toGetInfofontRatio( void ); // to return current font ratio

// for subtitle
bool toSetSubtitleVisible( bool on ); // to set subtitle visible or not
bool toGetSubtitleSetting( void );    // to get current subtitle setting, true = visible, false = invisible )
bool toFetchSubtitleFile( char *fullName ); // to get subtitle file from the Internet and will store it in "/tmp" ( default folder ).  fullName = http://xxx.xxx.xxx/aaa.srt <http://xxx.xxx.xxx/aaa.srt>
bool toSetSubtitleFileName( char *fileName );    // to set subtitile file and to use it ( the file must exist in /tmp before setting it ) fileName = aaa.srt
bool toSetSubtitleFontfile( char *fontName );
bool toSetSubtitleFontColor( int r, int g, int b, int a );
bool toSetSubtitleFontUp( void );
bool toSetSubtitleFontDown( void );
int toGetSubtitleFontRatio( void );

Regarding to the upgrade feature, you should have the usage document already. Please have a try also.
We need your comments after you have a try. Thank you!

(The sub-title will be modified to support non-block mode when downloading srt file.
Without this feature, your html may block until the srt file is downloaded
completely. )
